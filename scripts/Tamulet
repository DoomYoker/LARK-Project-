echo "Approaching the path, you come to notice that the screams you heard are now silent. You can make out the light of the phoenix in the distance, to where the big shadowy figure was. You slowly approach to realize that this being was mearly just a griffen. A mother griffen in fact, for which a gigantic nest lay under her. She seems to be caressing its empty bowl as the phoenix sits next to it, nodding to you to come closer. You move closer, slowly approaching as the mother bird glances at you and calls out."

echo "You slowly raise your hand, as the mother bird lowers her head. You move it over her head and carefully pat it, noticing the tears from her eyes. As you see the sad state the mother bird is in, the amulet springs from your chest and floats to your side facing the nest. It then turns to you."

tput bold; echo "Merlin: "; tput srg0; echo "Poor innocent creature. Who would have done something like this."
